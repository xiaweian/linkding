## PikaPods

[PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/) has a revenue sharing agreement with this project, sharing some of their revenue from hosting linkding instances. I do not intend to profit from this project financially, so I am in turn donating that revenue. Thanks to PikaPods for making this possible.

See the table below for a list of donations.
